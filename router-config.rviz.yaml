# Configuration for a host running a "listener" ROS 2 node
#
# 1. allowlist - List of topics that the DDS Router will forward.
#    Any topic not included in this list will be blocked by the DDS Router.
#    This list can be updated at run time.
# 2. external_partipant: - address (Husarnet Hostname) of a host running a
#    Fast DDS Discovery Server, that is used for a service discovery only.
#    Message (over "/chatter1" topic)exchange that is done p2p.
# 3. After you uncomment `"rt/chatter2"` section in allowlist both in 
#    router-config.listener.yaml & router-config.talker.yaml, then
#    also "chatter2" messages will be forwarded that are now available
#    only locally on host running "talker" nodes.
